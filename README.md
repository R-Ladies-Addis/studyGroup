# R Ladies Addis Study Group

Welcome to [R Ladies Addis](https://r-ladies-addis.github.io/studyGroup/)'s Study Group project!  

### What's a 'R Ladies Addis Study Group'?

R Ladies Addis Study Groups are fun, informal meetups of your friends and colleagues from around Addis Ababa to share skills, stories and ideas on using code for research, and explore open research practices. The goal is to create a friendly, no-pressure environment where people can share their work, ask for help on a coding problem, and learn and work together with their peers.
